# Pomodoro 🍅⏳

iOS Pomodoro application - stay focus on a task and take a break after.

### Manage your time

This application is based on the time management method called `Pomodoro`. You split your tasks in several intervals, each one lasts generaly 25 minutes, and at the end of the time, you take a small break before to start the next session [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

The name comes from the italian word `tomato` after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that the method creator used as a student.
